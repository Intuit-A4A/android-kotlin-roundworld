# Round World Craft Demo

Welcome! Intuit has started an exciting new project: a Compose-based Android app called *RoundWorld*. We hope that this new app will help users learn more about countries around the world.

Our app is just getting started. So far, here's what we have:

- This project is a simple compose-based Android app that displays a list of countries and their respective flags.
- The network backend doc is https://restcountries.com/ for REST API and https://graphql.country/ for GraphQL API.
- The base network layer interface is already implemented and you can extend it to provide concrete implementation for fetching data from the backend
- Some files within this repo has notes "* Note: This is part of the network layer infrastructure, and not required to be changed
  in user stories as part of the craft A4A" notes. These are network layer infrastructure files and is not required to be changed during the course
  of the interview process. You're welcome to look at them, but they are not part of the interview.

Now we need your help to build things out!

Please build and run the app to see how it works so far.
